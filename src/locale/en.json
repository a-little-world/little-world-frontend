          "question": "Why Little World?",
          "answer": "The integration of immigrants is greatly facilitated through the acquisition of German language skills. However, a significant number of refugees and newcomers face barriers in accessing language learning opportunities, exacerbated by the current COVID-19 situation. Little World offers a comprehensive solution by facilitating language learning through its platform, fostering connections across communities and promoting social inclusion and equal opportunities."
        },
        "q2": {
          "question": "Isn't it possible for language learners to engage in language tandem learning opportunities",
          "answer": "Tandem learning partnerships can be highly beneficial. However, it is often the case that individuals are primarily interested in acquiring proficiency in widely spoken languages such as English, Spanish, or French. Conversely, a vast majority of immigrants to Germany bring non-mainstream languages such as Hindi, Ukrainian, or Amharic, making it challenging to find suitable tandem partners. Little World addresses this issue by providing a platform where individuals can connect and engage in German language practice."
        },
        "q3": {
          "question": "What about language teachers or language schools?",
          "answer": "While traditional language courses are highly recommended, they are often plagued by lengthy waiting periods or prohibitive costs for self-funded immigrants. These courses may offer academic instruction, but lack the essential component of practical language usage through speaking with native speakers. Little World offers a practical solution to this challenge, providing a platform for language practice with native German speakers"

        },
        "q3": {
          "question": "Is it only possible to help if I speak German?",
          "answer": "Yes, Little World provides an opportunity to practice speaking German, therefore, active participation in speaking the language is the optimal approach"
        },
        "q4": {
          "question": "And what if we can't think of a topic to talk about?",

      "time_commitment": {
        "q1": {
          "question": "An honorary post. I don't have the time for that, do I?",
          "answer": "Little World provides a flexible and accommodating volunteer service that can easily be integrated into your daily routine. The program offers complete autonomy in terms of how and when you can participate, and even a small commitment of 30 minutes a week can have a significant positive impact on others"
        },

          "question": "Can I also skip a week?",
          "answer": "Certainly, we understand that everyone has prior commitments and obligations in their daily lives. If the volunteer service does not align with your schedule, you have the option to cancel the appointment at any time. Little World values flexibility and allows you to choose the time that works best for you."

Our team strives to match you with a compatible conversation partner, however, if for any reason the connection does not work out, it is not a problem. We are always ready to provide you with new and pleasant individuals to engage in conversation with."
        },

          "question": "How are you financed?",
          "answer": "So far, Little World has been sustained through personal funds and small grants. In the mid-term, our goal is to secure funding from local government entities and the federal government, as we cannot solely rely on existing resources. Our objective is to continue providing free access to all participants, with a specific emphasis on supporting socially disadvantaged individuals and refugees."
